        </p>
        <p>

        no personal data are gathered.<br>

        <h3>2.2. COOKIES</h3>
        <p>When you access each page of this website, this generates 
            the so-called temporary cookies, to facilitate browsing. 
            These cookies do not contain personal data and are deleted 
            at the end of each session (when the User leaves the page 
            or closes the browser). This website does not use technology 
            that permits monitoring of User access behavior.
        </p>
        <h4>What are cookies?</h4>
        <p>
            Cookies (or “connection testimonials”) are small pieces of data that 
            a website stores in the user’s browser and are sent to the website 
            with each request. Cookies may be:
        <ul>
        <li>First-party cookies: stored by the website the user is visiting 
            and sent only to this website.</li>
        <li>Third-party cookies: Websites may use external services that may 
            also instruct the browser to store its own cookies.</li>
        </ul>
        Depending on their durability, cookies might be:
        <ul>
        <li>Persistent cookies: they are stored on your device and are not 
            automatically deleted when you close your browser, with a 
            variable validity depending on the cookie.
        </li>
        <li>Session cookies: they are deleted when you close your browser.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>What are the other local storage mechanisms?</h4>
        <p>
            Long-term persistent local storage (local persistent to the browser) 
            are mechanisms that allow the use of small servers in your browser 
            for small server use without this data being automatically sent to 
            the server on each request.
        </p>
        <h4>Why use cookies and other mechanisms?</h4>
        <p>
            The purpose is to allow the website to remember the user preferences 
            (user session, language, etc.) over a period of time. This way, users 
            don’t have to re-enter them while browsing the site during their visit.
        </p>
        <p>
            They may also be used to collect statistical data about the user’s 
            browsing experience on our website.
        </p>
        <h4>What types of cookies and other local storage mechanisms do we use?</h4>
        <p>
            This website mainly uses first-party cookies. However, for statistical 
            purposes and for some embedded content (videos, maps, among others), 
            it uses systems originating from external organizations that may store 
            cookies and other local data storage mechanisms.<br><br>
            In order to manage your usage options, they are grouped into three 
            categories:
        </p>
        <p>
            Required: These are essential for the website to function. This category 
            includes only what is necessary to ensure basic functionality and 
            security features of the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Performance and analysis (statistical): they are limited to evaluating 
            the way in which the user interacts with our website as an anonymous 
            user (the data collected does not identify him). They are used to help
            us understand how we can improve the services we provide to those who 
            visit us. However, you can refuse cookies and other local storage 
            mechanisms of this category.
        </p>
        <p>
            Third-party content: a small number of pages on the website may contain, 
            embedded in the page, video playback systems, maps and others from third 
            parties (YouTube videos, Vimeo videos, Google Maps maps, among others). 
            As this content belongs to third parties, even if some of them do not 
            place any cookies or other local storage mechanisms, as is the case with 
            several of these systems, it is not possible to guarantee that this 
            situation will not change in the future. You can therefore refuse 
            cookies and other local storage mechanisms of this category.
        </p>
        <h4>How to manage your options for using these mechanisms?</h4>
        <p>
            When accessing this site for the first time, you are asked to 
            indicate your preferences for the use of cookies and other local 
            storage mechanisms. You can accept the three categories described 
            or you can set your preferences in another way. In managing 
            preferences, you are given more specific information about these 
            mechanisms that can be stored in your browser. In the case of the 
            “Performance and analysis (statistical)” and “Third-party content” 
            categories, you will be asked for your express consent to their use. 
            Your usage preferences will be valid for 180 days since your last 
            visit, but you can change your consent at any time by accessing 
            the Settings. If changes are made to this website that include 
            the modification of the set of cookies and other local storage 
            mechanisms used, you will be asked again to define your 
            preferences for use.
